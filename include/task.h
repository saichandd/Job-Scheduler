/*
 * Syntax of a task:
 * A task consists of a sequence of one or more "pipelines", separated by semicolons ;.
 * A pipeline consists of a sequence of one or more "commands", separated by vertical bars |
 *   and optionally followed by one or both of an "input redirection" and an "output redirection",
 *   either order permitted.
 * A command consists of a sequence of "words", separated by whitespace characters.
 *   The first word of a command is interpreted as the name of an executable program and the
 *   remaining words are interpreted as arguments to be passed.
 * An input redirection consists of the character '<' followed by a word, which is interpreted
 *   as the name of a file from which input is to be taken.
 * An output redirection consists of the character '>' followed by a word, which is interpreted
 *   as the name of a file to which output is to be sent.
 * A word is a sequence of consecutive non-delimiter characters, where delimiter characters
 *   comprise whitespace, semicolons ;, vertical bars |, less-than <, and greater-than >.
 * Optional whitespace is permitted around the delimiters ; | < and >.
 *
 * The following definitions describe a linked-list representation of commands, pipelines,
 * and tasks.
