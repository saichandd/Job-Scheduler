# UNIX Job Spooler

This is a job spooler program for UNIX to add multiple tasks without waiting for a particular running task to finish.

The programme accepts user requests to spool tasks for execution, cancel jobs, pause and resume jobs, show the status of jobs. The programme also expunges terminated jobs in the background to free resources for new tasks.
